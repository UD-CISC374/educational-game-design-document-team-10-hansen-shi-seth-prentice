# Game Name

## Elevator Pitch

Math Magician is a cute dungeon-crawler wherein the player will utilize an array of spells revolving around mathematics to defeat enemies in turn based battles. Player's gain new mathematical 'powers' after beating the boss of each level thereby increasing the complexity of the puzzles and enemies. Concepts includes basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.

## Influences (Brief)

- Counting Kingdom:
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: Arithmetic puzzle-esque game, our game is a similar concept
- Darkest Dungeon:
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: This game uses a turn based combat system. Fights tend to have gimmicks or puzzle elements which is similar to our game as fights will be turn based and puzzle-esque. 
- Cat Quest:
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: This game is cute has heck and it has a similar aesthetic to what we want to emulate for our game. The 2.5d gameplay is also similar to what the non-combat portions of our game would be.
- Indivisible 
  - Medium: Game
  - Explanation: A recent title that blended 2-d platforming with party based, real time combat. For our game we envisioned something similar wherein the player can navigate a 2-d platformer world and then launch into an rpg style turn based gameplay style when encountering enemies.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Enter into a level
- Collect consumable "number shards"
- Navigate the level by running and jumping
- Run into enemies to engage in combat
- Combat is turn based
- Form spells by combining number shards
- Spells damage is based on the values and how they are combined (ex. addition vs. multiplication)
- Each level has a boss
- Defeating the boss completes the level and will give the player a new ability

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

- Basic arithmetic 

## Target Audiences

- Younger demographics who may be struggling with arithmetic
- Younger demographics who want an entertaining way to practice their mathematical skills

## Target Contexts

- This game can act as one of the various options available to elementary/middleschool students during computer lab sessions
- This game could be used as an additional source of practice outside the classroom 

## Learning Objectives

- Apply the Big 4: After playing, students should be able to solve simple math problems revolving around the 4 arithmetic operators
- Determine Other Solutions: After playing, students should be able to evaluate a simple math problem and propose a variety of solutions given that more than one exists
- Mix and Match : After playing, students should be able to combine and utilize different operators to solve mathematical problems

## Prerequisite Knowledge

- Players should be able to recognize common mathematical operators (+, -, x, รท, /)
- Players should have some amount of experience using these operators
- Players should ideally have some level of experience with 2-d platformers to be able to navigate the game world adeptly

## Assessment Measures

- One could have a pre-test and post-test where each student is given a time limit (let's say 15 minutes). We would then compare the overall completeness and correctness of the pre-tests against the post-tests.
- A variation on this method would present the students with a pre-test and post test and they would be timed to see how long it takes them to complete each. We would then compare the average time needed to complete each test and the average scores on each test.

# What sets this project apart?

- The dichotomy between the two gameplay styles (2-d platformer and turn-based rpg) creates an engaging experience and in regards to its educational aspects, presents a natural "break" timer inbetween the "learning" sections (combat)
- Mathematics is generally considered a difficult subject and often disliked by students. Presenting it in a more palatable form to a younger audience may help them develop their skills and interests in the subject early on leading to a smoother transition later when math becomes an integral part of their academics
- Creating a decent educational game centered around math is a difficult science, therefore we should dedicate more efforts towards finding various solutions to this conundrum
- It's gonna be cute as heck (hopefully)

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

The game is single player with keyboard and mouse controls. Navigation is done with the arrow keys and combat sections will be played with the mouse (clicking and dragging).

## Player Modes

*Your game has one or more player modes. Describe each discrete mode, considering things like menus too. Generally describe the transitions between modes too.*

- Start screen/menu: The player can navigate a menu, tweak options, and start the game
- SinglePlayer: The player progresses through various levels until they defeat the final boss and effectively win
- (fun idea) Grownup Mode: Similar to singleplayer mode but enemies are more difficult and tougher math concepts are convered. Meant to be rather challenging.

# Gameplay Objectives

- *Primary Objective #1*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *Primary Objective #2*:
    - Description: *Description*
    - Alignment: *Describe how this aligns with one or more learning objectives*
- *etc.*

# Procedures/Actions

Players will be able to move left and right and jump. You will be able to change screens by going through doors. When encountering an enemy you will be able to use spells you have the resoures for to defeat them. When you find number crystals you can pick them up to add to your set of spells.

# Rules

*What resources are available to the player that they make use of?  How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?*

# Objects/Entities

- Number crystals
- Health potions
- Basic enemies, skeletons, slimes, ect.
- Doors
- Bosses

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

- Move horizontally through the world.
- Collide with number crystals to collect them
- Collide with enemies to enter combat
- In combat, select spells from your pouch to solve the enemies equation
- Use doors to progress to different stages
- In combat, your enemy hitting you deals damage
- At 0 health you lose
- Collide with health potions to heal
- Use chests to generate a bunch of items

    
## Feedback

*Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).*

*Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.*

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

At the start of the dungeon the mechanics of the game will be laid out in short signs, having to complete the actions described to progress.

## Presentation of Content

*Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.*

## Story (Brief)

You are a brave Math magician who is delving into the depths of the arithmetic dungeon to get rid of monsters and find treasure!

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.*

# Assets Needed

## Aethestics

*Give a sense of the aesthetics of your game, the spirit and atmosphere. Use descriptive, evocative words that can help the reader understand the emotional response of your game.*
